# Remove Images From OOXML files

These scripts will remove most images from your valid DOCX, PPTX or XLSX files.

They will run on Windows XP or higher and require 7-Zip installed on your C drive.

See https://www.7-zip.org/ if you do not have it installed.

*How to use the scripts*
- Make sure you have 7-Zip installed on your C drive.
- Extract the ZIP archive downloaded from this page into one directory. You need the images in the same directory as the BAT files.
- Drag your DOCX. PPTX or XLSX files and drop them on the RemoveDocxImages, RemovePptxImages or RemoveXlsxImages BAT files or use command-line interface.
- If everything goes well, the new DOCX, PPTX or XLSX file will appear in the same directory as the original one.

The new files will have all JPEG, PNG and EMF files replaced with gray boxes.

*Note: OLE binary embeddings will not go.*
